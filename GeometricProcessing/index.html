# Geometric Processing
High resolution images, please see on a monitor.
## Adaptive Meshing
These meshes are as coarse as possible, while trying to keep higher sampling in high curvature areas.

## Simple Mesh Downsampling
These are simple meshes for non-adaptive simulation and 3D printing, displayed heree just for context. Adaptive meshes like the examples above are the best approach. The high resolution mesh was used to print the geometry on a high transparency polymer.
